**world_co2_vs_primary_energy_perecent.png**
*Graph showing yearly total 'CO2 emmissions' and normalized 'Annual change in primary energy consumption %' globally.*
1. We see that World CO2 emmisions started decreasing since 2018-2019 which is very positive
2. We also see that there is a big dip in 'Annual change in primary energy consumption %' during times of global reccession. Including 2008 and 2020.
3. Interestingly, we see correlation between the two metrics, with large dips in 'Annual change in primary energy consumption %' correlate with sizable dips in CO2 emmissions.
4. Key Takeaway: While global ressessions are a net-negative in terms of human wellfare, it does question the viability of endless growth and it's impact on CO2 emmissions.
5. Personal Observation: Perhaps a paradigm shift from the current growth driven economic model to a more sustainable economic model would increase the chances of a better future.

*Graph showing yearly total 'CO2 emmissions' per income-level.*
2.  Key Caveat: The countries in X-income countries keep changing each year. A country could be in Low-Income one year, and Lower-Middle-Income the next. This graph is mainly about showing the relationship economic development and emmissions in general. 
3.  Low-Income countries show the smallest ammount of CO2 emissions. Which also shows the connection between economic growth and emissions.
4.  Interestingly, Higher-Middle-Income countries actually show a larger growth rate compared to High-Income countries, the later being actually in a gradual decline since around 2007.
5.  Personal Observation: While there are many possible interpertations from this graph. A key point I can see is middle-income i.e. growing countries, have high emissions due to infrastructure development to transition to High-Income. A smoother transition to Higher Income levels might be a key factor in decreasing global emissions.

**fossil vs renewable.png**
*Graph showing yearly normalized per capita 'Fossil Fuel' and 'Renewable Energy' in kWh globally.*
1. We see that that fossil fuel has actually plateued around 2010 and has been seeing a declining trend even before 2020.
2. We also see almost the same dips from 'CO2 emmissions' at 2008 and 2020 in fossile fuels. Cementing the correlation between fossil fuels consumption and CO2 emmisions
3. On the other hand, Renewable energy is showing a universal increase over the years, with signs of an almost exponential increase starting from around 2003
4. However, the porportion of renewable to fossil is almost 1/10000. 
5. Personal Observation: Current renewable energy generation methods are limited in scale, there is a large room for growth for alternative more scalable energy sources such as nuclear energy.

*Graph showing yearly normalized per capita 'Fossil Fuel' and 'Renewable Energy' in kWh per Income-level*
2. The global trend of plateauing fossil fuels is also appearent across income levels.
3. While High-Income countries show a decreasing trend in Fossil Fuels. They still have the largest per capita consumption, more than double the amount of High-Middle-Income countries.
4. While High-Income countries have less total CO2 emissions than Higher-Middle-Income countries. Per Capita it's the opposite. Due to Middle-Income countries having a bigger population.
5. Personal Observation: While the relationship between income-level and emmissions is appearent, the implications are very complex. This is a great area for further research and analysis.
6. On a positive note, Renewable energy per capita almost quadroupled since around 2003 in both High-Income and Higher-Middle Income countries. Also

2. This visualization should not be used for definite insight. However, it does help us better understand the relationship of these key metrics across time.
